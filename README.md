# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
In order to decide the next move for Louise, we are looking at the outcomes(Canceled, Failed, Successful) of other theatrical productions based on their Launch Date and funding Goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
#### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
##### The Rise
By looking at the "Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date" line chart below, we can see that the successful campaigns started to rise in April. In April there are 71 successful campaigns(113 Total Campaigns: 62.8% Successful) with a spike leading into May; Peaking at 111 successful campaigns(166 Total Campaigns: 66.8% Successful).

##### The Decline
After May there is a visable decline. June ended with 100 successful campaigns(153 Total Campaigns: 65.3% Successful), July had 87 (138 Total Campaigns: 63.0% Successful), with a pretty steady decline going all the way to December; Which has the lowest successful campaign count of 37(75 Total Campaings: 49.3% Successful). 


#### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
When looking at the "Outcomes Based on Goal" line chart below, there is obviously a high success rate(75.8%) in the "Less Than 1000" category. In the $10,000 - $14,999 range, there is a 54.1% chance of success.

Some more information of note is that campaigns with a funding goal of $35,000 - $44,999 had a success rate of 66.6%! This is interesting because other than the lower campaign funding goals($1000-$4,999), the success rate is significantly higher than other campaigns. More analysis would be needed to determine the factor causing the higher success rate.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
In the future, it may be difficult to find the deciding factors causing the higher success rates for the higher funding goals of $35,000-$44,999.

## Results
### Conclusions of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
With May having the highest success rate and June coming in a close second, both Months are a great option for launching a theatrical production campaign.

Also, even though it is on the decline, July might be a good option as well due to there only being a 2.3% difference in success rate between July and June. Based on the numbers, I also advise steering clear of the Holiday seasons. When looking at the line chart you can clearly see a very low success rate around these times.

### Conclusions of Outcomes Based on Goals
With the numbers showing the $0-$4,999 range with the highest success rate, these goal amounts would be ideal for the highest successful campaign odds.

We also can't ignore the spike in success between the $35,000-$44,999 range. With a success rate of 66.6% for 9 total projects, it would be too soon to speculate if this range is a true viable option. This does conclude that there are much less campaigns to compete with in the range $35,000-$44,999.

### Limitations of this dataset
To determine the true success rate of the $35,000-$44,999 range mentioned above, more data would need to be gathered. There are too few campaigns to determine if this ranges success rate is truly 66.6%.

### Another table and chart recommendation
It may be worth creating another table and line chart showing the success rate of campaigns based on their backer count and the Country the campaign was run in.
